      question: 'How is this different from other compatibility tests?',
      answer: 'Most compatibility tests are based on general questions and provide surface-level insights or scores. This assessment is fundamentally different because it is built on your individual CliftonStrengths® profiles — a research-based framework developed by Gallup®. Instead of generic results, you receive a deep, personalized analysis of how your unique strengths interact, highlighting where you align, where you complement each other, and where tension may arise in real-life situations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do I need to take the Gallup® assessment separately?',
      answer: 'You need to take the official assessment directly from Gallup® to ensure your results are authentic and based on their proprietary scientific research. We then use those official results to generate your custom relationship analysis.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost?',
      answer: 'Our Relationship Synergy Map bundle is a one-time fee of $129. Please note that the cost of the initial CliftonStrengths® 34 assessment from Gallup® is separate.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I have already taken the CliftonStrengths® assessment?',
      answer: 'If you and your partner have already taken the CliftonStrengths® 34 assessment, you can simply upload your existing PDF reports during the checkout process. There is no need to take the test again.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What exactly will I see in the 12-page Relationship Synergy Map?',
      answer: 'You will receive a comprehensive breakdown including the Dynamics Matrix, a Complementarity Roadmap, a Talent Gap Analysis, and a Conflict Heatmap, all designed to give you actionable insights into your partnership.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if our strengths are completely different? Are we incompatible?',
      answer: 'Not at all! Completely different strengths often make for the most powerful partnerships because you complement each other. Our report will show you how to turn these differences into a unified advantage rather than a source of conflict.',
